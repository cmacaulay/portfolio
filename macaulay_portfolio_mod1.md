# (Your Name) - (M1/M2/M3/M4) Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

My goals this module were to: 
1) Get projects finished ahead of time (stay on top of time management).
2)Get to class on time every day. 
3) Pass and achieve each of the learning goals.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

(Intro)

#### (Project Name)

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/cmacaulay/jungle_beats)
* [Original Assignment]()

In Jungle Beats I created a Linked List, a data structure commonly used by computer scientists, which holds
data within individual nodes. Jungle Beats includes methods that enable you to append, prepend, and insert
data into the list, remove the last node, and check to see if specific data is included within the list. 
Specifically, this Linked List will play back the sounds given to it as data that is stored within the nodes.

### Gear Up

I. Growth Mindset 12/2
Coming from the education world, "growth mindset" is a definitely a current buzzword. First introduced to it in an elementary 
school, it seemed like such a straight forward concept - putting it into action, however, is an entirely different story. 

As a perfectionist, it is sometimes hard for me to accept that not everything is going to be exactly as it should be. From 
what I've learned/seen about software development so far is that there isn't just one way to do things, and you should go 
down the route that makes the most sense to you. I think that this will help with my perfectionism - there isn't a "perfect" way to do it, I should trust my gut and do it my way. I am coming into Turing with extremely limited coding experience, and knowing that this is all new to me, the expectation that I'll not understand everything is there. 

My triggers that would send me back to a fixed mindset are: 
- If I've tried approaching/researching something multiple times and it still isn't working. 
- If I get advice, try it, and it doesn't work I will be frustrated - if the person helping me didn't know what was going on, how am I supposed to get it?

My peers can help by asking me questions that will help me view the problem/challenge from a new perspective, and by asking 
for my help because teaching will help me learn something. 

My main takeaways from the Growth Mindset Gear Up were: 
- Adopt the "power of yet" vs. the "tyranny of now"
- Praise the process
- Meaning of effort & difficulty are transformed

II. 12/9
#### Vote Your Conscience

* [https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/vote_your_conscience.markdown]()

It was difficult to refrain from talking about the current election in the context of this discussion, but I was totally impressed by everyone's judicious efforts to not inject their own personal opinions into the fray. We were all more or less in agreement that we appreciated when leaders are able to clearly articulate their positions while remaining pragmatic about their proposed solutions.
